# basic-random-password-generator

V1.0.0

- Goal of this project was to create a basic HTML and JS application to create a random password

- I built this for a current course I am working on, I know there are ways to improve it but am happy with how it works currently

- 0 dependencies as far as I know, user is able to run in liveserver extension on VScode or the old fashioned way
